1.consider the matrix A with the values,
	a = ([['Rhia',10,20,30,40,50],
           ['Alan',75,80,75,85,100],
           ['Smith',80,80,80,90,95]])
 perform the following operations and print the resulting matrix.
	1. slice the matrix and the output will be  
 	 	[['Rhia',10],
  		['Alan',75],
  		['Smith',80]]
	2. update third row as ['Sam',82,79,88,97,99]
	3. replace the 4th element of first row as 95
	4. add a new column in this matrix with the following values, 73, 80 and 85.

2. Consider the following sentence,

#Python is an interpreted high level programming language for general-purpose programming*.

i) remove all special characters from this.
ii) Print all   palindromes in the sentence
iii) print the repeating words and number of times it repeats  

3. Given two sets A and B,
   A = {5, 3, 8, 6, 1}
   B = {1, 5, 3, 4, 2}
      Perform the following operations and print the resulting set,
	i) union
	ii) intersection
	iii) set difference
	iv) find maximum and the minimum value of set A and B

4. Write a program to print the prime numbers in the interval 900-1000, and also find if any palindrome is in the result.
